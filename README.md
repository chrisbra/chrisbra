### Hello there, I am Chris

I work at [Ataccama] as [Senior Platform Consultant]. My spare time I nowadays
mostly spend on [Vim] where I am one of the maintainers now and help to lead
the projects direction. I am also quite active within the greater Vim
community with my own Vim plugins, Reddit and Stackoverflow.

Outside of work, I am a pretty boring person :see_no_evil:. I go hiking, like
travelling, photography and spend my time with my family.
